## Local Development

This playbook includes Molecule that will spin up a local docker environment to deploy, configure and test this playbook.

Development requirements:

- Docker
- Molecule
- yamllint
- ansible-lint

or simply use a VM with [this](https://github.com/justin-p/ansible-terraform-workstation) configuration.

### Basic Molecule usage

- Build a container and apply the current playbook: `molecule converge`  
Note, when using converge the container is not destroyed, allowing you to quickly test changes by running this command consecutive times.

- Interact with the containers created by molecule: `molecule login`  
Note, this works great with converge allowing you to peek inside the container and manually check why things didnt work.

- Apply tests defined in the `verify.yml` file: `molecule verify`

- Remove any containers left over from the converge command: `molecule destroy`

- Run the playbook and any included tests against clean containers: `molecule test`
